 # How to?
```NOTE
Note: I recommend you to use [universal-android-debloater](https://github.com/Universal-Debloater-Alliance/universal-android-debloater-next-generation/releases) a PC program; but if you don't have a PC you can use [LADB](https://motog34.github.io/guide/?post=how-to-use-LADB) to remove bloatware
```

Some terminology (only applies to system apps, and to this guide):

- **Disable:** Think it as a toggle, when turned on an app can't expand anymore, can't run, it just like bacteria can't grow anymore when freezed but still alive.
- **Completely disable:** Similar to disable but it will make the app size 0 B when viewed from app info.
- **Uninstall:** Roughly speaking, removes for the specific user but the installer still remains in the system.
- **Completely uninstall (needs root user access):** It literally means what it means; the particular package (aka app) will no longer be in the system.

Talking about space, a completely disabled app is going to save 0 space when uninstalled.

Also some disabled apps show some space like 24 kB, 6 MB. Make sure their updates are removed and you cleared the app data that is possible to be cleared. And if even after that they don't show 0 B, consider them completely disabled, you can't do much on them. And I don't know if you could save any space by uninstalling them. App size like 24 kB is negligible, although 6 MB is not but you can ignore it if 6 MB is only for one-two app(s).

In some cases it's better to completely disable an app instead of uninstalling it.

**To completely** disable the app:

1. **Disable the app** either from app info if you can, or by 
```
pm disable-user --user 0 pkgName`
``` 
2. **Uninstall its updates** if any (ie restored it to factory version), [here's how](xxxxxx) (you will see the search icon there if there aren't any updates) and
3. **Clear its data** either from the app info if you can, or by 
```
pm clear pkgName
```
(if the clear app data option is greayed out and there is app data that could be cleared, enable the app, then clear its data, and then disable it or simply use the command to clear it)

**To enable the app** you can either from the app info if you can or by pm 
```
enable pkgName
```
universal-android-debloater does all the three steps in one click for you, but doing these steps in ladb is a hassle (unless you're a pro).

So if you're using ladb you may want to uninstall the app instead of disabling it because of the hassle:

```
pm uninstall --user 0 pkgName
```
And **to get it back**, 
```
pm install-existing pkgName
```
