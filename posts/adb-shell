Roughly speaking, shell is a program inside which you enter commands and it runs them for you.
In our context there are two types of shell:
- system shell: zsh, bash if you're on linux, macos; or the default program which runs the command for you when you open command-promt powershell in windows
- adb shell: the shell inside which adb commands are run
Running 
```
adb shell enable *pkgName*
```
is equivalent to
running 
```
enable *pkgName*
```
inside adb shell.

To enter adb shell, just run 
```
adb shell
```
inside a terminal or command-prompt. Note that command-prompt is not a shell, it's another program to access the shell similar to linux, macos terminal. Also note that in LADB you are by default inside adb shell.
